The goal of this android project is to pull together techniques shown in class to make a program which responds graphically to **accelerometer** input. I am going to make a simple ball game!

Approach:

- Subclassing View
- Using the Accelerometer
- Adding constraints
- Enabling Fullscreen mode
- Drawing multiple balls
